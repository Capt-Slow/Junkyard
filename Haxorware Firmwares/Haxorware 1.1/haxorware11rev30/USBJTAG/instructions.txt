USBJTAG Instructions:

If your modem is currently running infinite firmware it is recommended to restore it to stock, like it was out of the box.
To do this you restore your 2MB backup that i hope you made before flashing infinite.
The commands are as follows:
  detect
  ldram 9fc00000
  (A File Open dialog will appear, find your 2MB backup file and click open)
  program 9fc00000 200000

It is recommended you make a backup before flashing haxorware (or any other hacked firmware) onto your modem.
To create a 2MB backup with usbjtag enter the following commands:
  detect
  getram 9fc00000 200000
  save 9fc00000 200000
  (A save as dialog will appear, choose where to save your 2MB backup)

To program haxorware to your modem using USBJTAG, please overwrite your usbjtag.def with the one from this archive.
After that, start USBJTAG and choose the SB5101 profile (Tools->Config will open the profile selection dialog)
Then issue the following commands:
  detect
  ldram Firmware
  (A File Open dialog will appear, find haxorware11rev30.bin and click open)
  program Firmware

After the flashing is complete, reboot your modem and enjoy Haxorware
